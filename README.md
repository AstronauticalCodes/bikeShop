# Bike Shop 

Web applications help various businesses promote their products, manage orders effectively, and communicate well with customers. In this project, I will implement a web application for a bike shop. The application will allow customers to order a custom bike of their choice, provided that the relevant bike parts are in store. The shop employees will be able to manage the orders and update the status of the available parts. Ready for a ride? Let's go!
